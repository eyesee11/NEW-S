                        <th><p>Social media sleuths don’t miss the tiniest of details, like cricketer Riyan Parag’s infamous YouTube search history, let alone glaring editing failures – case in point, the mysterious hand on Rohit Sharma’s shoulder in this picture.

                    Standing next to the Indian captain is Yogesh Patel, the Director of Swami Vivekananda International School who offered him a freeship back in the day.The two recently caught up following team India’s homecoming to Mumbai from their victorious T20 World Cup 2024. Patel, who met Sharma at Wankhede Stadium, later posted photos from their reunion online.

                    Sharing on Facebook, he wrote: “I had the honour of witnessing the historic victory celebrations of the T20 World Cup in both 2007 and 2024 at the renowned Wankhede Stadium. The experience was extraordinary and unmatched, truly a once-in-a-lifetime event. The incredible support from Indian cricket fans, who travelled from across the country to express their love, respect, and admiration for the champions, was incredible. The electrifying presence of millions of fans at Wankhede Stadium was unforgettable. I am immensely proud of our legendary Rohit Sharma for his all-round performance and world class Captaincy.”
                    In one of the pictures, Patel embraces Sharma from the side as they pose for the camera. However, three hands appear placed around the 37-year-old’s body, with the outlier being the one on his right shoulder.</p></th>

                <p>In a major development, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have reportedly asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift India's Champions Trophy 2025 games to Dubai or Sri Lanka as the national side will not travel to Pakistan. The mega event is scheduled to take place in Pakistan early next year. The showpiece tournament will make its return after 2017 when Sarfaraz Ahmed-led Pakistan beat India in the final to win the competition in England and Wales.Recently, BCCI sources told Indian news agency ANI, "It is highly unlikely that the team will travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy but a final decision will be taken by the government. So, in that case, a hybrid model is being worked out. India may play their matches in UAE or Sri Lanka just like the Asia Cup. Although the ICC will also have their stand on it, as of now this is what we are thinking of. Let's see how things go in the future. As of now, it looks like it will be played in a hybrid model."</p>

                    <p>Mumbai: As expected, the Rohit Sharma-led Indian cricket team is unlikely to travel to Pakistan for the upcoming 2025 Champions Trophy. As per a report on ANI, the BCCI wants the tournament to be held in either Sri Lanka or in Dubai. The Indian board is officially going to make a request to the International Cricket Council over this. It would now be interesting to see what does the ICC do. Will they oblige or not?
                        According to a report in Telegraph, the eight-team tournament will be staged across three venues with Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Lahore set to host matches from February 19 to March 9. As per the provisional schedule, the Indian cricket team play Pakistan in Lahore on March 1.
